### TD 1 :

- basic computation and data manipulation on meshes (computation of Laplacian, cotan matrix ...)

- exact diffusion on surface using Laplace-Beltrami operator

- approximate diffusion on surface by solving  the generalized eigen value problema

- computation of the Heat Kernel Signature (HKS) descriptor  to compare surface

- Heat Method for geodesic computation
